CSS custom framework

I have created 4 buttons with four different states that can be used for various options. the colors that were used for these buttons are from our theme colors, which is in the variables.scss file. you can simply add the button classes .button-primary, .button-secondary, .button-info and .button-warning in your HTML file code and add the button that you prefer. You can also customize any button styles according to your preference by going to input.scss and editing the @mixin btn-styles section.
