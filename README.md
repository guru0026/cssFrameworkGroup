LIST FRAMEWORK

The list framework I created is a quick way to stylize your list. If you use the class "list-style"on your div or ul it will add padding a thick border and light background into the container while it has a border shadow beneath it. If that doesn't work for you you can always use the class "ul-style". It changes the background color of the container red and adds padding inside as well. The list items can also be customized with the classes as well. If you use the class "list item" it adds borders beneath each of the list items with padding and uses the color black for the font. If you use the class "li-style" it uses no borders adds padding and changes the font color to blue.
