Venushka's button framework
I have created 4 buttons with four different states that can be used for various options. the colors that were used for these buttons are from our theme colors, which is in the variables.scss file. you can simply add the button classes .button-primary, .button-secondary, .button-info and .button-warning in your HTML file code and add the button that you prefer. You can also customize any button styles according to your preference by going to input.scss and editing the @mixin btn-styles section. 

Mohamed's list framework
The list framework I created is a quick way to stylize your list. If you use the class "list-style"on your div or ul it will add padding a thick border and light background into the container while it has a border shadow beneath it. If that doesn't work for you you can always use the class "ul-style". It changes the background color of the container red and adds padding inside as well. The list items can also be customized with the classes as well. If you use the class "list item" it adds borders beneath each of the list items with padding and uses the color black for the font. If you use the class "li-style" it uses no borders adds padding and changes the font color to blue.
